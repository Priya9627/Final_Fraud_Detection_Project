PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE

Q) What is the primary goal of your fraud detection model?

-  The primary goal of a fraud detection model is to accurately identify fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives (legitimate transactions      incorrectly flagged as fraud) and false negatives (fraudulent transactions not detected). Here are the main objectives of a fraud detection model using a Naive Bayes Classifier:

1) Maximize Accuracy: Correctly classify as many transactions as possible, both fraudulent and non-fraudulent.

2) Minimize False Positives: Reduce the number of legitimate transactions that are incorrectly classified as fraudulent, which can negatively impact customer experience and trust.

3) Minimize False Negatives: Reduce the number of fraudulent transactions that go undetected, which can lead to financial losses and other negative consequences for the organization.

4) Real-time Detection: Implement the model in a way that allows for real-time or near-real-time detection, enabling immediate action on potentially fraudulent transactions.

5) Scalability: Ensure that the model can handle large volumes of data efficiently, as fraud detection systems often need to process large datasets.

6) Adaptability: The model should be able to adapt to new types of fraud as they evolve, possibly through retraining with new data.


Q) Why are sensitivity and precision important for this project?

- Sensitivity (also known as recall) and precision are crucial metrics for a fraud detection project for several reasons:

 Importance(Recall):

Detecting Fraud: High recall ensures that most fraudulent transactions are detected, minimizing the financial loss and damage caused by fraud.
Customer Trust: Missing a fraudulent transaction can have severe consequences for both the customer and the company. High recall helps in maintaining customer trust and safeguarding their assets.

Importance(Precision):

Reducing False Alarms: High precision reduces the number of false positives, which are legitimate transactions incorrectly flagged as fraud. This helps in minimizing inconvenience and frustration for customers.
Operational Efficiency: Investigating false positives consumes resources and time. High precision ensures that resources are efficiently used to investigate only the most likely fraud cases.

Balancing Sensitivity and Precision
In fraud detection, there's often a trade-off between sensitivity and precision. Improving sensitivity (recall) might reduce precision because more transactions are flagged as potentially fraudulent, increasing false positives. Conversely, improving precision might reduce sensitivity, leading to more false negatives (missed fraud).​
 

A high F1 score indicates a good balance between precision and recall, making it a useful metric for evaluating the overall performance of your fraud detection model.

Practical Implementation
When evaluating and tuning our fraud detection model, we should consider both sensitivity and precision to ensure a balanced and effective approach:

By focusing on both sensitivity and precision, we ensure that our fraud detection model is effective in identifying fraudulent transactions while minimizing the impact on legitimate transactions.


DATA ANALYSIS

Q) What is the class distribution of fraud vs. non-fraud transactions in your dataset?

-  Understanding the class distribution is crucial as it helps in selecting appropriate techniques to handle class imbalance, such as resampling methods (oversampling the minority class or undersampling the majority class), using different evaluation metrics, and applying specialized algorithms designed to handle imbalanced data.

The dataset is highly imbalanced, with non-fraudulent transactions (class 0) vastly outnumbering fraudulent transactions (class 1).
This imbalance is typical in fraud detection datasets and poses a challenge for training models, as the classifier might be biased towards the majority class.

Q) Does the 'Time' feature help in predicting fraud? How?

- The 'Time' feature in the creditcard.csv dataset represents the elapsed time in seconds since the first transaction in the dataset. Whether the 'Time' feature helps in predicting fraud depends on its relationship with fraudulent transactions. 

First, we can visualize the distribution of the 'Time' feature for both fraud and non-fraud transactions to see if there are any noticeable patterns. Then,plotted histograms of the 'Time' feature for both classes to see if their distributions differ.

Checked the correlation between the 'Time' feature and the target variable to see if there is any linear relationship.

Interpretation
Visual Patterns: If the histograms show different patterns for fraud and non-fraud transactions, it indicates that 'Time' might have some predictive power.
Feature Importance: If 'Time' has a significant coefficient in the logistic regression model, it suggests that 'Time' is a useful predictor.
Correlation: A significant correlation between 'Time' and 'Class' would indicate a linear relationship.

The 'Time' feature can help in predicting fraud if it shows significant differences in the distribution between fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions, has a significant statistical relationship with fraud, and is found to be important in a predictive model. However, it is essential to combine it with other features and use appropriate modeling techniques to achieve the best performance in fraud detection.

DATA PREPROCESSING

Q) Why should the amount feature be standardized in fraud detection analysis?

- Amount feature was not on same scale as principle components. So, I standardized the values of the 'Amount' feature using StandardScalar and saved in data-frame for later use. Standardizing the 'Amount' feature (or any numerical feature) in the credit card fraud detection analysis is crucial for several reasons:

1. Improving Model Performance
Equal Weighting: In many machine learning algorithms, features are implicitly assumed to have similar scales. If the 'Amount' feature is not standardized, its scale can dominate other features, potentially skewing the results. Standardizing ensures that each feature contributes equally to the model.
Convergence Speed: Algorithms like gradient descent (used in logistic regression and neural networks) can converge faster when the features are on a similar scale. Standardization often leads to better and faster convergence.
2. Handling Outliers
Reducing the Impact of Outliers: The 'Amount' feature can have a wide range of values, from very small transactions to very large ones. Standardizing helps to reduce the influence of extreme values, making the model less sensitive to outliers.
3. Comparability
Feature Comparability: Standardization allows you to compare the effects of different features on the model output more effectively. This can be useful for interpreting the model and understanding which features are more important.
4. Consistency
Consistent Interpretation: Standardized features have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This consistent scale allows for easier interpretation and comparison of feature coefficients, particularly in linear models.

Standardizing the 'Amount' feature is a critical step in preparing the data for fraud detection analysis. It helps ensure that the feature scales do not distort the model's learning process, leading to improved performance, faster convergence, and more reliable and interpretable results.

Q) Which features are dropped during preprocessing and why?

- Some of features had very similar shapes for the two types of transactions, so we beleive that dropping them should help to reduce the model complexity           and thus increase the classifier sensitivity.
  Dropped some of principle components that have similar distributions in previous plots.
-By removing some of the reduntant principle components, I gain in model sensitivity and precision.
  After that dropped some of principle components + Time.
-"Time_Hr" was not helping much in classification. So, we can remove it safely.
  Lastly, dropped some of principle components + Time + 'scaled_Amount'
-So dropping some of redundant feature  ofcourse helped to make calculations fast and gain senstivity.

MODEL TRAINING

Q) How does Gaussian Naive Bayes handle continuous features?

-For continuous features like 'Amount' and 'Time', Gaussian Naive Bayes fits a Gaussian distribution to each feature for each class. Here’s how it handles these features:

Estimate Parameters: For each feature and each class, GNB estimates the mean and standard deviation from the training data.
Compute Likelihood: For a new data point, it computes the likelihood of each feature value given the class using the Gaussian PDF.
Classify: It multiplies the likelihoods of all features and combines them with the prior probabilities of each class to make a prediction.

Q) What are the steps in training the Naive Bayes model?

- Steps
# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

Train the Model
# Initialize the Gaussian Naive Bayes model
gnb = GaussianNB()

# Train the model
gnb.fit(X_train, y_train)

MODEL EVALUATION

Q) How are sensitivity and precision calculated? 

- The sensitivity (also known as recall) and precision are calculated based on the confusion matrix, which provides the counts of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.

Q) What metrics do you use to evaluate model performance?

- In fraud detection, it’s essential to look at multiple metrics to get a complete picture of model performance:

Accuracy: Overall correctness.
Precision: Reliability of fraud predictions.
Recall (Sensitivity): Ability to detect all fraud cases.
F1 Score: Balance between precision and recall.
Confusion Matrix: Detailed view of prediction results.
ROC AUC: Performance across different thresholds.
PR Curve and Average Precision: Performance on imbalanced datasets.

RESULTS AND INTERPRETATION

Q) What are the key findings from your model's predictions?

- Nodoubt, LR gives better model sensitivity, but positive predictive value for NB is more than double (although low for both). As said in introduction, Naive-Bayes is just simple prob. calculator, no coeff. optimization by fitting etc. , so this is quick learner. We can hopefully improve NB's performance by playing around with default threshold on calculated probabilities, but still 89% of fraud cases are detected, great NB!

Q) How do different threshold values affect model performance?

- Threshold Values: Adjusting the threshold affects the classification results and model performance metrics. High thresholds typically increase precision but decrease recall, while low thresholds increase recall but decrease precision.

Impact on Metrics:
High Threshold:
Precision: Increases because only cases with very high probabilities are classified as positive, leading to fewer false positives.
Recall: Decreases because fewer actual positive cases are classified as positive, leading to more false negatives.
Overall Effect: High thresholds make the model more conservative, reducing the number of positive classifications and thus potentially missing more positive cases.
Low Threshold:
Precision: Decreases because more cases with lower probabilities are classified as positive, increasing the number of false positives.
Recall: Increases because more actual positive cases are classified as positive, reducing the number of false negatives.
Overall Effect: Low thresholds make the model more lenient, capturing more positive cases but also potentially misclassifying more negative cases as positive.

MODEL IMPROVEMENT

Q) What are the limitations of Naive Bayes for fraud detection?

- While Naive Bayes is a simple and computationally efficient model, its limitations include:

Assumption of feature independence
Handling of continuous features
Sensitivity to class imbalance
Struggles with complex feature interactions
Sensitivity to feature scaling
Handling of missing data
Simplistic assumptions about data relationships
These limitations mean that while Naive Bayes can be a good starting point for fraud detection, it may need to be complemented with other models or techniques to improve performance, especially when dealing with complex, imbalanced, or noisy data.

Q) What other algorithms could improve performance?

- Different algorithms and methods can address various limitations of Naive Bayes:

Ensemble methods like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting can improve performance by combining multiple models.
Neural Networks and SVMs can capture complex patterns and interactions.
Anomaly Detection methods can be tailored for detecting rare fraud cases.
Resampling techniques can help manage class imbalance effectively.
Using a combination of these methods, along with proper model tuning and validation, can lead to better fraud detection performance.
